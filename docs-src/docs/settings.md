# Game settings

## Maze size

Maze size can be modified by specifying the `row` &times; `column`.

## Snake length

Snake length controls the growing of the snake after eating a food.

=== ":material-pan-horizontal: Dynamic snake lenth"

    The snake will grow by one for each food it eats.

=== ":material-dots-horizontal: Fixed snake length"

    The snake length will maintain from the beginning to the end. Any food eaten will not change the length of the snake.

## Starting snake length

This defines the snake length at the beginning of a game.

## Food number

This defines the number of food generated when no food is available on the game field. For multiple food, new food will only be generated when all the food is consumed.

## Confirmation

You will need to confirm the change before the settings takes place, and the game will be reset.
