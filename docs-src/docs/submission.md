2. Report (`.pdf`)

    The report should include the problem description, the explanation of problem formulation and search algorithm implementation, the results of the algorithms, and the discussion to evaluate the performance of the agents/players.

    Here are some questions that may help you in considering the content to be included in the report.

    1.  What is the problem the algorithm need to solve?
    2.  How do the different parameters of the problem fit into the algorithm?
    3.  How do you make the algorithm understand and be able to solve this particular problem?
    4.  Do the results achieve the aim of solving the problem (can you obtain the solution)?
    5.  How are the performance of the algorithms (how good are the solutions)?

    Be reminded that these questions are just guidelines and you should not just directly answer these questions. 

## Marks distribution

| Criteria |   %   | Remark |
|:---------|:-----:|:-------|
| Functional codes      | 20 | Your code should work without throwing exceptions |
